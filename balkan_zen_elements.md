# Balkan Zen

## Shapes

### Fildžan (feel-jahn)

A small, handleless ceramic cup for "domaća kafa" (Serbian/Turkish coffee).

### Čokanjčić (cho-kahn-cheech)

A small, pear-shaped glass with a narrow neck for serving Rakija - traditional fruit brandy.

### Stav: Polako

Attitude: Slowly / Take it easy.
A fundamental Balkan law that says everything can wait. If you are slow enough—most problems will eventually solve themselves.

### Promaja: Nema

Draft: None / No draft.
The legendary Balkan supernatural force believed to cause everything from back pain to sudden death.
"Promaja: NEMA" means here you are safe and cozy.

### Kafa: Čeka Se

Waiting for coffee / Coffee is brewing.
A "loading state" of the Balkan soul. A daily ritual where all tasks are paused until the coffee is served.
The socially acceptable reason to procrastinate.

### Rakija: Samo Malo

Rakia: just a little.
The fine line between the 'samo jednu' (just one) and overwhelming Balkan hospitality.
